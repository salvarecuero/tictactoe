# TicTacToe
Yup, the simplest TicTacToe you've ever seen. Made just to test myself and have some fun, not a that-much-serious project. Made in a couple of hours, should probably take less ;)


## Run Locally



Clone the project

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/salvarecuero/tictactoe.git
```

Go to the project directory

```bash
  cd tictactoe
```

Install dependencies

```bash
  npm install
```

Start the server

```bash
  npm run start
```
